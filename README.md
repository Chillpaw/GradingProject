# GradingProject
This is a beginner project to learn C# through the MS Learn C# learning path: https://learn.microsoft.com/
The aim of the project is to create a score card for a group of student's exam scores. I've tried to enhance the original solution by attempting to create a Student class to abstract some of the processing into the creation of a new student object to clean up the main module.
